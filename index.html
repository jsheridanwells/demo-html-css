				<h2>We are not in Kansas anymore</h2>
				<p>The film begins in Kansas, which is depicted in a sepia tone. Dorothy Gale lives with her dog, Toto, on her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry's farm. Toto gets in trouble with a mean neighbor, Miss Almira Gulch, when he bites her. However, Dorothy's family and the farmhands are all too busy to pay her any attention. Miss Gulch arrives with permission from the sheriff to have Toto put down. She takes him away, but he escapes and returns to Dorothy, who then decides to run away from home, fearing that Miss Gulch will return.</p>

				<p>They meet Professor Marvel, a phony but kindly fortune teller, who realizes Dorothy has run away and uses his crystal ball to dupe her into believing that Aunt Em is ill so that she must return home. She races home just as a powerful tornado strikes. Unable to get into the storm cellar, she seeks safety in her bedroom. A wind-blown window sash hits her in the head, knocking her out. She then awakens to find the house has apparently been picked up and sent spinning up into the air by the tornado. She looks outside the window and sees several farm animals, an old lady sitting in a chair knitting, two men rowing a boat, and Miss Gulch, who transforms into a cackling witch flying on a broomstick.</p>


				<p>Dorothy (Judy Garland, right) with Glinda the Good Witch of the North (Billie Burke)
				The house crashes in Munchkinland in the Land of Oz, and just as Dorothy opens the door the film changes to Technicolor. Glinda the Good Witch of the North and the Munchkins welcome her as their heroine â€“ the house has landed on and killed the Wicked Witch of the East, leaving only her feet poking out from under. In the middle of the celebration, the Wicked Witch of the West arrives in a ball of smoke and fire to claim her sister's ruby slippers, but Glinda transports them onto Dorothy's feet before the witch can get them. She swears revenge on Dorothy for her sister's death. Glinda tells Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, where the Wizard of Oz might be able to help her get back home.

					<h3>Ruby Slippers</h3>
					<p>
						The ruby slippers are the magic pair of shoes worn by Dorothy Gale as played by Judy Garland in the classic 1939 MGM musical movie The Wizard of Oz. Because of their iconic stature,[1] the ruby slippers are now considered among the most treasured and valuable items of film memorabilia.[2] As is customary for important props, a number of pairs were made for the film, though the exact number is unknown. Five pairs are known to have survived; one pair was stolen in August 2005[3] and has never been recovered.
